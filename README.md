# 🌍 FAIRMEDIA  
## AI-Powered Bias Audit & Responsible Content Ranking System  

> **Reducing algorithmic bias without altering reality.**

---

## 🚨 Problem

Modern AI systems learn from biased internet data containing:

- Gender bias  
- Stereotypes  
- English language dominance  
- Under-representation of communities  

This leads to **algorithmic discrimination**, unfair ranking, and distorted digital visibility.

---

## 💡 Solution

**FAIRMEDIA** is a **Responsible AI system** that:

- Detects bias using **NLP + Machine Learning**
- Provides **Explainable AI (XAI) bias scores**
- Applies **Smart Re-weighting algorithms**
- Enables **Fairness-aware content ranking**
- Maintains **Human-in-the-Loop oversight**
- Supports **Multilingual & regional language inclusion**

⚠️ We do **NOT** edit or delete content.  
✅ We reduce bias at the **AI decision layer**, not the content layer.
