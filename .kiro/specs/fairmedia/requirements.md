 # Requirements Document: FAIRMEDIA

## Introduction

FAIRMEDIA is an AI-powered bias audit and mitigation system designed to detect and reduce bias in digital media content. The system addresses the critical problem of AI systems being trained on internet datasets containing gender bias, stereotypes, and English language dominance, which perpetuates these biases in news, search results, and content recommendations.

The system uses machine learning, natural language processing, and explainable AI techniques to identify bias patterns, provide transparent bias scoring, and apply intelligent re-weighting strategies to reduce bias influence without content deletion or editing. A human-in-the-loop approval mechanism ensures ethical oversight and control.
